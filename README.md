# Chatbox
I'm just trying to make a simple chatbox to further my web dev knowledge.

This will eventually include MongoDB integration and work through the NodeJS framework. I plan
to host it (both during development and afterwards) on Heroku.


UPDATE 2/12: Heroku isn't playing nice with MongoDB (it gives an Application Error) so I need to find alternative hosting. Until then I probably won't be pushing many commits.
