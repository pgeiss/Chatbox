# Chatbox
I'm just trying to make a simple chatbox to further my web dev knowledge.

This will eventually include MongoDB integration and work through the NodeJS framework. I plan
to host it (both during development and afterwards) on DigitalOcean.

UPDATE 6/5: I switched to DigitalOcean and everything works a lot more nicely than on Heroku. Still have a bit of legwork to do on the project, though.
