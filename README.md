# Chatbox
A lightweight and responsive web chat application hosted on DigitalOcean. Features Node.js's Express.js and Socket.io plugins as well as MongoDB integration. Basically everything is accomplished using a combination of those three modules (as well as a few niche modules a la CookieParser).

# Current Development Goals
* SSL usage for the login page.
* Add channels like in IRC.
* Make some pages "more" responsive (ie, to tablets and large phones instead of just small phone and PCs).
* Add new ways to send content such as photos.
* ~~Create a proper frame for the chat page.~~
