# Chatbox
A lightweight and responsive web chat application hosted on DigitalOcean. Features Node.js's Express.js and Socket.io plugins as well as MongoDB integration. Basically everything is accomplished using a combination of those three modules (as well as a few niche modules a la CookieParser).

# Current Development Goals
* ~~SSL usage for the login page~~ -- <i>SSL was applied everywhere.</i>
* Add channels like in IRC. -- <i>Probably working on this next.</i>
* Make some pages "more" responsive (ie, to tablets and large phones instead of just small phone and PCs).
* Add new ways to send content such as photos.
* ~~Create a proper frame for the chat page~~ -- <i>Accomplished, but a little wonky on mobile</i>
* Create a native mobile app on iOS to provide all functionality in-app. -- <i>Currently working on this.</i>
